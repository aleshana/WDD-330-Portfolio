        <ul>
            <li>
                When is better to use .innerText or .createNodeText?
            </li>

            <li>
                You can change CSS inside an element, what is required to change the actual file?
            </li>
            <li>
                It seems that the forEach can be used for the same purposes as "for...of"  loop, 
                is that correct?
            </li>
            <li>
                I appear to be getting an error in the "view.hide" function, or at least it is not 
                working on the start button.  Since I copied and pasted it, and spent quite a bit of time
                trying to debug it, I am still not sure what is wrong.
